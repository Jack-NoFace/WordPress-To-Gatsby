I focus on front-end applications and have experience with React, NextJS, Gatsby, WordPress, Timber, and most of the related frameworks.

üöÄ I have an obsession to make web products faster.

## Back to the talk Jack üëÄ

### WordPress ‚û° Gatsby

This presentation is a step by step process on how I have somehow managed to import my WordPress to the popular static site generator, Gatsby.

---

## Let's first define some of the technologies being used

---

## WordPress

I assume many of you in the room know what WordPress is.

However, for those who need a recap, WordPress is a CMS (Content Management System).

Super popular, and used in a large portion of all sites on the web.

---

## Headless WordPress

I want to make this clear distinction that whilst WordPress is useful for quick brochure site builds and handling of data, we are not going to be using traditional PHP or Twig files to generate our pages.

Instead we are going to be creating custom API endpoints from WordPress and importing that data to Gatsby later.

---

## Gutenberg

For anyone using WordPress, I assume you know what Gutenberg is.

For better or for worse.

Gutenberg is the default post content editor, available as of WordPress 5.0.0.

---

## Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

ACF is a must have for any developer looking to improve their themes.

ACF allows developers to add custom fields (who'd have thought?) to posts and pages on a WordPress site.

Not only this, but as of ACF 5.8.0 (We are using a beta build) you can now attach custom fields to Gutenberg blocks.

---

## React

---

## Styled Components

---

## Gatsby

Gatsby is a static site generator that can generate static HTML files from data imported into the framework.

The final result is that which encompasses all of the latest and greatest available in React tooling with an old-school feel of hosting a site made up of HTML, CSS and JS files alone.

---

As Gatsby is a fresh technology, many developers are opting to search for new CMS alternatives to WordPress which are compatible with Gatsby.

Either that or they are completely rebuilding their sites in markdown files.

I'm in favour of porting existing technologies to improve client usability and reduce the cost of embracing new technologies.

---

## Netlify

Finally we're going to host our site on one of the most delightful hosting platforms available.

Netlify is completely free to get started with hosting static sites, and will automatically build and deploy our site when repository changes are made to our code.

Alternatively we can kick off a build from the WordPress dashboard using webhooks.

---

## Still with me? üòÖ

I know we've covered 8 technologies, frameworks or plugins.

It can seem like this talk is going to be intense but I'm no confessed expert with these tools.

I do know how to build an MVP though, and that's what we're going to cover in this presentation so raise your hand if you have any questions during the talk (or save them for the end).
