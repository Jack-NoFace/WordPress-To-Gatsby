## Shameless Plug

### Taking on projects for summer 2019

I focus on front-end applications and have experience with React, NextJS, Gatsby, WordPress, Timber, and most of the related frameworks.

üöÄ I have an obsession to make web products faster.

## Back to the talk Jack üëÄ

## WordPress to Gatsby

This presentation is a step by step process on how I have imported my WordPress website data to one of the most popular static site generator, Gatsby.

---

## First things first!

### let us define some of the technologies being used

---

# Our Backend üçë

---

## WordPress

I assume many of you in the room know what WordPress is.

However, for those who need a recap, WordPress is an open source CMS (Content Management System).

Super popular, and used in a large portion of all sites on the web.

---

## Headless WordPress

I want to make this clear distinction that whilst WordPress is great for a large portion of general client sites and handling of data, we are not going to be solely relying on traditional PHP or Twig files to generate our pages.

Instead we are going to be creating custom API endpoints from WordPress and importing that data to Gatsby later.

---

## Gutenberg

For anyone using WordPress, I assume you know what Gutenberg is.

For better or for worse.

<Notes>
	For those who aren't up to date on the WordPress drama surrounding Classic
	Editor over Gutenberg - Gutenberg is the default post content editor,
	available as of WordPress 5.0.0.

    I know it has it's issues.

However, I think the block building experience is here to stay.

</Notes>

---

## Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

ACF is a must have for any developer looking to improve their themes.

ACF allows developers to add custom fields (who'd have thought?) to posts and pages on a WordPress site.

Not only this, but as of ACF 5.8.0 (We are using a beta build) you can now attach custom fields to Gutenberg blocks.

---

# Our Frontend üé®

---

## React ‚öõ

---

## Styled Components

---

## Gatsby

Gatsby is a static site generator that can generate static HTML files from data imported into the framework.

The final result is that which encompasses all of the latest and greatest available in React tooling with an old-school feel of hosting a site made up of HTML, CSS and JS files alone.

<Notes>
As Gatsby is a fresh technology, many developers are opting to search for new CMS alternatives to WordPress which are compatible with Gatsby.

Either that or they are completely rebuilding their sites in markdown files.

I'm in favour of porting existing technologies to improve client usability and reduce the cost of embracing new technologies.

</Notes>

---

## Netlify

Netlify is one of the most delightful hosting platforms available.

Even better, it's completely free to get started with hosting static sites, it'll even automatically build and deploy our site when changes are made to our repositories.

## So...

- WordPress

## Still with me? üòÖ

I know we've covered 8 technologies, frameworks or plugins.

## My Prefered way of learning/teaching

I am a man that loves to build and learn from mistakes.

I don't have the patience to read articles without actually going away and building something.

---

## With that in Mind

I've set myself a task, to rebuild my personal website https://whatjackhasmade.co.uk üîå

---

## We'll be going from concept to deploy

---

## Designs

I'm a big fan of atomic design, for anyone unfamiliar, atomic design is a concept of looking at pages and slicing them into smaller and smaller components.

<Notes>
	Brad Frost is the dad of Atomic Design so I highly recommend checking out his
	material if you want to learn more.
